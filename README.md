Instructions are below to run the project;

Download the project on your machine.

Clean and compile Maven by entering ‘mvn clean compile’ in the terminal.

Only run the ‘testRunner’ class to run the tests.  
   - all the test cases on the feature files matches the same tag on 'testRunner', therefore it will run all the 
   test cases at once.
   
   - If you would like to run specific test case, simply change the tag on the 'testRunner' and make sure the tag is the 
  same above the test case on the feature file.
